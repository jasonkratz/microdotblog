With a Samsung T5 external SSD drive running on a MacBook Pro with an M1 Pro chip. I even set it to ignore stuff like the Applications folder, my Parallels VM folder, etc. Nothing made a difference. In situations like this I often turn to Howard Oakley over at The Eclectic Light Company.</p>\n<p>Howard has a diagnostic tool for Time Machine called T2M2 but it didn&rsquo;t help me. More searching on his website brought up <a href=\"https://eclecticlight.co/2023/07/13/how-to-make-time-machine-backups-faster/?ref=notes.jasonkratz.me\">How to make Time Machine backups faster</a>.

				"content_text": "Just going to say out of the chute that Time Machine has pretty much been flawless for me since I got a Mac. It's saved my bacon more than once. Which is why I was surprised when trying to do the first backup of my work Mac that it wasn't even finishing after days.\n\nDays. With a Samsung T5 external SSD drive running on a MacBook Pro with an M1 Pro chip. I even set it to ignore stuff like the Applications folder, my Parallels VM folder, etc. Nothing made a difference. In situations like this I often turn to Howard Oakley over at The Eclectic Light Company.\n\nHoward has a diagnostic tool for Time Machine called T2M2 but it didn't help me.
