			 <p>Elie Mystal, <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/charlie-kirk-white-supremacist">writing</a> in The Nation about Ezra Klein&rsquo;s terrible piece on Charlie Kirk in the NYT, keeps saying &ldquo;white&rdquo; as if that means anything in a terrible opinion piece. Bad takes are bad takes dude, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what the race is of the person they&rsquo;re coming from. (and oddly he points out Joan Walsh&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/society/charlie-kirk-assassination-tragedy">piece</a>. Last time I checked she&rsquo;s white. So a person&rsquo;s race only matters when the takes are bad?)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also remind Elie that there is such writing in the NYT as well, The Nation isn&rsquo;t alone in people being able to hold 2 things in mind at once about Charlie Kirk.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;d also note that Ross Douthat is off his rocker too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fact that he was himself a college dropout, leaving college early to found Turning Point USA, was almost the perfect touch: There is nothing more normally American than choosing a really good entrepreneurial opportunity over the full undergraduate four years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dropping out of school to start your own business is &ldquo;normally American&rdquo;? Really?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And what he argued for, in general, was not some extreme or esoteric form of right-wing politics. He wasn’t a school of one, a would-be philosopher of nationalism or a prophet of post-liberalism. He belonged to and maneuvered within the Trump-era conservatism mainstream, which meant he could be combative and pugilistic and say extreme things (this is 2025, after all) while remaining closer to a normal Republican voter than to the very-online vanguard.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sure. Charlie had a lot more in common with the rural farmer than the nuts on X. And of course he was part of the &ldquo;very-online vanguard&rdquo;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>whether his particular persona, and especially his evolution from college bro to Christian dad, was modeling a more fundamentally normal future for the right than some of the later-Trump-era alternatives.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The guy that thought someone should bail out the nut that attacked Paul Pelosi with a hammer? The guy who lied about fraud in the 2020 election and lied about the COVID vaccine? That&rsquo;s the guy you think might be modelling the &ldquo;normal future&rdquo; for the right?</p>
<p>We are in a <strong>really</strong> weird place right now.</p>

			 <p>I’ve switched over to the Apple default apps for mail and task management, and thought I’d try Journal as well. Long story short: it’s just not ready for someone used to Day One. It has promise but it’s just too janky right now. I do most of my writing on the Mac and the Mac version of the app is, as far as I know, the iPad version. I can’t do things like CMD-X/C/V. Image handling, while pretty cool as you can resize and have text flow around the images, is super janky so I ended up having to put them in the old-fashioned way, full size.</p>
<p>It just isn’t worth the hassle given how mature Day One is and I’ve been using it since…well…day one. I expect that at one point it will be pretty good and worth trying again but today is not that day.</p>

		<a href="https://blog.jasonkratz.me/2025/08/30/the-eternal-infernal-time-machine/" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2025-08-30 15:30:00 -0500">Aug 30, 2025</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Just going to say out of the chute that Time Machine has pretty much been flawless for me since I got a Mac. It&rsquo;s saved my bacon more than once. Which is why I was surprised when trying to do the first backup of my work Mac that it wasn&rsquo;t even finishing after days.</p>
<p>Days. With a Samsung T5 external SSD drive running on a MacBook Pro with an M1 Pro chip. I even set it to ignore stuff like the Applications folder, my Parallels VM folder, etc. Nothing made a difference. In situations like this I often turn to Howard Oakley over at The Eclectic Light Company.</p>
<p>Howard has a diagnostic tool for Time Machine called T2M2 but it didn&rsquo;t help me. More searching on his website brought up <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2023/07/13/how-to-make-time-machine-backups-faster/?ref=notes.jasonkratz.me">How to make Time Machine backups faster</a>. I had already tried everything he mentioned there except for removing I/O throttling.</p>
<p>Funny enough this is the method most people have mentioned since about 2016 (and of course I had never heard of it in the ensuing 7 years). The command <code>sudo sysctl debug.lowpri_throttle_enabled=0</code> turns off the normal low priority that Time Machine has on the system (found out later that <a href="https://www.stclairsoft.com/AppTamer/index.html?ref=notes.jasonkratz.me">App Tamer</a> also has this as an available setting). To say that it made a huge difference was an understatement. My backup completed in a couple of minutes once I flipped that setting to disabled. I then removed everything I had added to the ignore list in Time Machine&rsquo;s settings which added about another 10 minutes and I was done.</p>
<p>There are two things to note with this command though: it resets upon reboot and it&rsquo;s a global setting, so now any other process that was set to a low priority is now potentially taking more resources.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still trying to figure out what was causing it to be so slow. None of my other Macs have this issue but none of them have all of the corporate crap installed on them either. I thought I had disabled all of that too but nothing made a difference until I changed that flag. It&rsquo;s worth a try if you&rsquo;re having the same issue. </p>

<p>The Jabanto smelled like a blueberry muffin when I squeezed the bag so it definitely lived up to the notes — at least on a squeeze. Very fruity! Looking forward to trying the Gundikhan tomorrow morning. Not sure if I’ve had beans from India as of yet.</p>

			 <p>Really like the look of Matt Langford&rsquo;s Mythos theme. It looks good and is simple. It reminds me how much I am not liking my Ghost setup which is too&hellip;Ghosty&hellip;for what I want.</p>

			 <p>I love Oliver Burkeman&rsquo;s writing. It always resonates with me and is very honest and down to Earth. It&rsquo;s very much like the Stoics. So it&rsquo;s not surprising that <a href="https://www.oliverburkeman.com/freshstart?ref=notes.jasonkratz.me">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no such thing as a fresh start&rdquo;</a> spoke to me as well, especially given <a href="https://notes.jasonkratz.me/2025-w32-a-weekly-review/">recent events</a>.</p>
<p>Part of what I hope for whenever I melt down a blog/social media account is some sort of fresh start. <em>This</em> time I&rsquo;ll do better. <em>This</em> time I&rsquo;ll &ldquo;do it right&rdquo;, whatever that means. That never happens. In Burkeman&rsquo;s opinion it&rsquo;s all just part of being a perfectionist in the first place.</p>
<p>He says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To put it another way: fresh-startism is a form of perfectionism, and as with all forms of perfectionism, the solution is to stop being such a perfectionist &ndash; to resign yourself to the fact that things probably won&rsquo;t unfold as flawlessly as you&rsquo;d hoped.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my experience they never do. There is no perfect anything, no matter how hard one might try to get it. That doesn&rsquo;t mean you won&rsquo;t find something that works for you, whatever that something is, but likely you stumbled on it by tweaking something, not a Big Bang restart that was perfect from the beginning.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing that is so frustrating about being a perfectionist: we&rsquo;ve already failed, many times over. The problem is we somehow think that next time is going to be different and it never is. It makes sense of course, we only learn by failing. Don&rsquo;t try to convince a perfectionist of that though.</p>
<p>Burkeman goes on to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The reason this is so liberating, for anyone with even a hint of perfectionism, is that it means you get to give up on the exhausting struggle to take charge of your life, so as to steer it in a new direction. You get to abandon all hope of one day finding the perfect time management system &ndash; or perfect relationship, job, neighborhood, etcetera &ndash; and relax back into the inescapable chaos and muddle of the one you have.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then &ndash; once you&rsquo;re facing your real situation, not fixating on a fantasy alternative &ndash; you suddenly find yourself able to start making a few concrete improvements, here and now, unburdened by any need for those improvements to usher in a golden age of perfection.</p>
<p>This is how I feel, as I mentioned in my weekly notes for this week, about my online presence. There is no &ldquo;perfect&rdquo;. There won&rsquo;t be so stop acting like there is, stop annoying people by switching things, only to do it again (and again&hellip;and again&hellip;). Tweak. Take breaks. Do whatever is necessary other than blowing it all up. That doesn&rsquo;t work. There is no such thing as a fresh start. What I&rsquo;ve got is all there is.</p>
