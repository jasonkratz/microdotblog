			 <p>I honestly do not get the whitewashing of the character and behavior of Charlie Kirk by people like Ezra Klein. Klein&rsquo;s latest piece in the NYT is off on everything but the fact that we shouldn&rsquo;t be turning to violence to settle our political scores. People have gone absolutely bananas.</p>

<p>Restarting this one from the beginning. Going to scan through and pick out the good bits. She spends far too much time on the anecdotes which I loathe. Unfortunately par for the course for this genre.</p>

			 <p>I get that people are pissed with Tim Cook over the White House visits. But letâ€™s stop pretending heâ€™s not doing exactly what needs to be done in the current political climate to meet his duties as CEO. How much money he makes isnâ€™t relevant.</p>

			 <p>Iâ€™ve switched over to the Apple default apps for mail and task management, and thought Iâ€™d try Journal as well. Long story short: itâ€™s just not ready for someone used to Day One. It has promise but itâ€™s just too janky right now. I do most of my writing on the Mac and the Mac version of the app is, as far as I know, the iPad version. I canâ€™t do things like CMD-X/C/V. Image handling, while pretty cool as you can resize and have text flow around the images, is super janky so I ended up having to put them in the old-fashioned way, full size.</p>
<p>It just isnâ€™t worth the hassle given how mature Day One is and Iâ€™ve been using it sinceâ€¦wellâ€¦day one. I expect that at one point it will be pretty good and worth trying again but today is not that day.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Just going to say out of the chute that Time Machine has pretty much been flawless for me since I got a Mac. It&rsquo;s saved my bacon more than once. Which is why I was surprised when trying to do the first backup of my work Mac that it wasn&rsquo;t even finishing after days.</p>
<p>Days. With a Samsung T5 external SSD drive running on a MacBook Pro with an M1 Pro chip. I even set it to ignore stuff like the Applications folder, my Parallels VM folder, etc. Nothing made a difference. In situations like this I often turn to Howard Oakley over at The Eclectic Light Company.</p>
<p>Howard has a diagnostic tool for Time Machine called T2M2 but it didn&rsquo;t help me. More searching on his website brought up <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2023/07/13/how-to-make-time-machine-backups-faster/?ref=notes.jasonkratz.me">How to make Time Machine backups faster</a>. I had already tried everything he mentioned there except for removing I/O throttling.</p>
<p>Funny enough this is the method most people have mentioned since about 2016 (and of course I had never heard of it in the ensuing 7 years). The command <code>sudo sysctl debug.lowpri_throttle_enabled=0</code> turns off the normal low priority that Time Machine has on the system (found out later that <a href="https://www.stclairsoft.com/AppTamer/index.html?ref=notes.jasonkratz.me">App Tamer</a> also has this as an available setting). To say that it made a huge difference was an understatement. My backup completed in a couple of minutes once I flipped that setting to disabled. I then removed everything I had added to the ignore list in Time Machine&rsquo;s settings which added about another 10 minutes and I was done.</p>
<p>There are two things to note with this command though: it resets upon reboot and it&rsquo;s a global setting, so now any other process that was set to a low priority is now potentially taking more resources.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still trying to figure out what was causing it to be so slow. None of my other Macs have this issue but none of them have all of the corporate crap installed on them either. I thought I had disabled all of that too but nothing made a difference until I changed that flag. It&rsquo;s worth a try if you&rsquo;re having the same issue.Â </p>

			 <p>I love Oliver Burkeman&rsquo;s writing. It always resonates with me and is very honest and down to Earth. It&rsquo;s very much like the Stoics. So it&rsquo;s not surprising that <a href="https://www.oliverburkeman.com/freshstart?ref=notes.jasonkratz.me">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no such thing as a fresh start&rdquo;</a> spoke to me as well, especially given <a href="https://notes.jasonkratz.me/2025-w32-a-weekly-review/">recent events</a>.</p>
<p>Part of what I hope for whenever I melt down a blog/social media account is some sort of fresh start. <em>This</em> time I&rsquo;ll do better. <em>This</em> time I&rsquo;ll &ldquo;do it right&rdquo;, whatever that means. That never happens. In Burkeman&rsquo;s opinion it&rsquo;s all just part of being a perfectionist in the first place.</p>
<p>He says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To put it another way: fresh-startism is a form of perfectionism, and as with all forms of perfectionism, the solution is to stop being such a perfectionist &ndash; to resign yourself to the fact that things probably won&rsquo;t unfold as flawlessly as you&rsquo;d hoped.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my experience they never do. There is no perfect anything, no matter how hard one might try to get it. That doesn&rsquo;t mean you won&rsquo;t find something that works for you, whatever that something is, but likely you stumbled on it by tweaking something, not a Big Bang restart that was perfect from the beginning.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing that is so frustrating about being a perfectionist: we&rsquo;ve already failed, many times over. The problem is we somehow think that next time is going to be different and it never is. It makes sense of course, we only learn by failing. Don&rsquo;t try to convince a perfectionist of that though.</p>
<p>Burkeman goes on to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The reason this is so liberating, for anyone with even a hint of perfectionism, is that it means you get to give up on the exhausting struggle to take charge of your life, so as to steer it in a new direction. You get to abandon all hope of one day finding the perfect time management system &ndash; or perfect relationship, job, neighborhood, etcetera &ndash; and relax back into the inescapable chaos and muddle of the one you have.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then &ndash; once you&rsquo;re facing your real situation, not fixating on a fantasy alternative &ndash; you suddenly find yourself able to start making a few concrete improvements, here and now, unburdened by any need for those improvements to usher in a golden age of perfection.</p>
<p>This is how I feel, as I mentioned in my weekly notes for this week, about my online presence. There is no &ldquo;perfect&rdquo;. There won&rsquo;t be so stop acting like there is, stop annoying people by switching things, only to do it again (and again&hellip;and again&hellip;). Tweak. Take breaks. Do whatever is necessary other than blowing it all up. That doesn&rsquo;t work. There is no such thing as a fresh start. What I&rsquo;ve got is all there is.</p>
